# Decision Tree Classification in Google Colab

This repository contains code and resources related to the Decision Tree Classification assignment using Python in Google Colab. The assignment covers loading and understanding the dataset, training a decision tree model, preparing data for training, visualizing the decision tree, evaluating the model, and conducting additional analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a modified version of the Kaggle dataset, available in the `weather.csv` file. It includes 1281 rows with 4 features and 1 output, representing weather conditions.
